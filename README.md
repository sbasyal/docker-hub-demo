# docker-hub-demo
Test the Docker Hub Automated build using a simple ubuntu image with Java 7 Installed in it.
This repository also tests the `Build Trigger` functionality. Please refer to `sbasyal/java-docker-examples` (https://github.com/sbasyal/docker-hub-demo) in GitHub to find the java program, that will trigger this build.
Also, this repository tests the `Repository Links` functionality. Another repository `sbasyal/docker-hub-submodule` is triggered automatically, if we trigger the build for this repository.
